the sun did not shine
it was too wet to play
so we sat in the house
all that cold cold wet day

i sat there with sally
we sat there we two
and i said how i wish
we had something to do

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball
so we sat in the house
we did nothing at all

so all we could do was to
sit
sit
sit
sit
and we did not like it
not one little bit

and then something went bump
how that bump made us jump
we looked
then we saw him step in on the mat
we looked
and we saw him
the cat in the hat
and he said to us
why do you sit there like that
i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny
but we can have
lots of good fun that is funny

i know some good games we could play
said the cat
i know some new tricks
said the cat in the hat
a lot of good tricks
i will show them to you
your mother will not mind at all if i do

then sally and i
did not know what to say
our mother was out of the house
for the day

but our fish said no no
make that cat go away
tell that cat in the hat
you do not want to play
he should not be here
he should not be about
he should not be here
when your mother is out

now now have no fear
have no fear said the cat
my tricks are not bad
said the cat in the hat
why we can have
lots of good fun if you wish
with a game that i call
up up up with a fish

put me down said the fish
this is no fun at all
put me down said the fish
i do not wish to fall
