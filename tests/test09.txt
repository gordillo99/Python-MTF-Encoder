the sun did not shine
it was too wet to play
so we sat in the house
all that cold cold wet day

i sat there with sally
we sat there we two
and i said how i wish
we had something to do

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball
so we sat in the house
we did nothing at all

so all we could do was to
sit
sit
sit
sit
and we did not like it
not one little bit

and then something went bump
how that bump made us jump
we looked
then we saw him step in on the mat
we looked
and we saw him
the cat in the hat
and he said to us
why do you sit there like that
i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny
but we can have
lots of good fun that is funny
